First Neat List

    Store the values 'python', 'c', and 'java' in a list. Print a statement about each of these values, using their position in the list.
    Your statement could simply be, 'A nice programming language is value.'

lang = ["python",'c',"java"]
print (lang[0],lang[1],lang[2])

print (lang[0] + "is very easy to learn" )
print (lang[1] + "is the language i have first lernt" )
print (lang[2] + "is the language, which i never lernt ever" )
